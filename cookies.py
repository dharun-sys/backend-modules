"""
üç™ Cookie Utility Module for Authentication
----------------------------------------------------------
This module provides helper functions to manage authentication
cookies in a secure and reusable way across the application.

Functions Included:
- set_auth_cookies(response, access_token, refresh_token):
    Attaches HttpOnly access and refresh tokens to the response object.

Planned Enhancements:
- clear_auth_cookies(response):
    Securely delete auth cookies on logout or session expiration.

Security Notes:
- Cookies are set as HttpOnly to mitigate XSS.
- You should ensure `Secure` and `SameSite` attributes are
  applied based on your deployment mode (production/dev).
